# HousesToOffices
1. Consider a city in which there are d residential buildings and p post offices. 
2. For simplicity, we will represent individual buildings (houses and post offices) as points on the plane with x and y coordinates.
3. For each residential building, we want to find the post office that is closest to it. 
4. We will measure the distance from the house to the post office simply as the length between these two points (i.e. air distance). 
5. We will print these nearest post ofices to the console and draw them into an image using the SVGdraw library.
